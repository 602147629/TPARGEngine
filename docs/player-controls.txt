the control setup for the player is as follows:

WSAD & ARROWS to move up, down, left, and right respectively.
SPACE to jump in the direction the player faces - 
jumping cannot be controlled in mid-air. 
player should jump to the tile after the adjacent tile (so skipping the adjacent tile and landing on the following tile)
X key will fire the weapon in the direction the player faces
if the player comes in contact with a ladder tile, 
pressing the C key should allow the player to climb: 
up keys should move up the ladder, and down keys should move down the ladder.
