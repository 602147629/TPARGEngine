Coding conventions:

classes and functions are always CapitalizedLikeThis

variables (member and local) are namedLikeThis

code blocks are always used even in cases where braces can be omitted by the language
such as one-liner if statements:
	if (condition) DoSomething(); 
should be written as
	if (condition) { DoSomething(); }

static functions and variables should be marked with the static keyword before the scope specification.
for example
static public const TILE_WIDTH:Number = 32;
static public function Negate(a:*) { a = -a; }

property setter functions should always use "value" as the sole parameter
for example
public function set Size(value:Number):void { mySize = value; }

private member variables should have the prefix "my" to designate the ownership of the class instance
such as

private var myImage:Image;

Try to avoid nested code blocks as much as possible.
